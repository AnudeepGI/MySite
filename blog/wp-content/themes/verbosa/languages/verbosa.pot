"<p>You wake up and you're a WordPress theme. You have a funny yet resonating "
"name. You can't quite recall it but it's definitely a feminine name,\n"
"\t\t\tone word, ending with the vowel 'a'. Always ending with that darn "
"vowel - that's a clear trademark for a Cryout Creations theme.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>People are always checking you out, previewing your lines, curves "
"and colors. Always keeping you in the spotlight, they're testing various "
"elements,\n"
"\t\t\tchecking to see if you can satisfy their specific needs, if you can "
"fit within the confines of their preconceived ideas of a perfect theme.\n"
"\t\t\tAnd when you do fit that description- the install button is pressed "
"and the horror begins...</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Articles and pages are constantly added, edited, sometimes deleted. "
"Countless plugins are cramped in, all shapes and sizes,\n"
"\t\t\tshamelessly biting at the fringes of compatibility. And when that "
"compatibility does fail, you're always the one to take the blame.\n"
"\t\t\tAnd so you're always being tampered with by those damned developers, "
"adding patch over patch over patch, relentlessly changing you\n"
"\t\t\t(they use the word 'improving' but we all know that's a lie) until you "
"barely resemble your initial form.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>And since you're a Cryout Creations theme, people can, and will, "
"customize you a great deal. You're one but you're not the same.\n"
"\t\t\tDifferent layouts, color schemes, fonts, widgets - you name it and "
"it's customizable. It's near impossible for you to know who you really are "
"anymore,\n"
"\t\t\ta myriad of personas and you can't relate with any of them. Plus, with "
"the whole responsive trend lately, they keep putting you in all these "
"tight,\n"
"\t\t\tuncomfortable places and expect you to just act natural.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>And sometimes, after all this probing and poking around, they "
"decide you're simply not good enough. You don't fit with the subject "
"matter.\n"
"\t\t\tYou're too dark. Too round. Not enough umph. So they choose another "
"theme, the first that shows up in search, some soulless Twenty-something\n"
"\t\t\ttheme and then just move on. And that- that is the worst. You feel "
"dirty, used and abandoned. But somehow you must move on as well,\n"
"\t\t\tbecause another download is in progress and that Install button is "
"about to be pressed once more... </p>\n"
